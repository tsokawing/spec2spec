# spec2spec demo Frontend

This is the folder containing the frontend code for spec2spec demo. It is built using pure JavaScript without using any popular JS frameworks.

This is a simple web interface. As long as you have a modern web browser, you should be able to load this page.

Again, because of its simplicity, there is no special steps to set this up.

## Notes on local deployment

This is by default configured to connect to the backend at `127.0.0.1:5000`, which is the default port for the backend if deployed locally. If you are running the frontend in a browser with the address bar showing `file://` instead of showing `http://`, you may need to disable CORS on your browser temporarily. Plugins are available on Chromium browsers to temporarily disable CORS.
